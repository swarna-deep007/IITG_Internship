# Near-Popular Roommate Matching

This project implements a **novel variation** of the Roommate Matching Problem, inspired by the Gale‚ÄìShapley Stable Matching algorithm, but adapted to **non-bipartite roommate graphs** using the notion of **popularity** instead of stability. The approach recursively explores induced subgraphs and attempts to minimize *unpopularity factors*.

## üî¨ Research Context

- **Classical Gale‚ÄìShapley**: Works for bipartite stable matchings (e.g., marriage problem).  
- **Roommate Problem**: Involves non-bipartite graphs where stability often cannot be guaranteed.  
- **Near-Popular Matchings**: Instead of perfect stability (impossible in many cases), the algorithm seeks matchings with minimized *unpopularity*.  

This implementation is based on the theoretical foundations of NP-hardness proofs and graph decomposition methods in matching theory.

## üìö What This Project Does

- Represents the roommate problem as a **graph** (`Graph` class).  
- Implements a **modified Gale‚ÄìShapley** matching between two dynamically chosen partitions of vertices.  
- Recursively applies **graph decomposition** on unmatched vertices to construct a near-popular solution.  
- Randomized **stable partitioning** ensures variability across runs.  
- Outputs a set of roommate matchings.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. Generate a random graph with `n` vertices (edges exist with some probability).  
2. Partition the vertices randomly into groups (`stablePartition`).  
3. Apply **Gale‚ÄìShapley‚Äìstyle proposals** between subsets (`galeShapley`).  
4. Collect matchings, recurse on leftover vertices (`unpopularityMatching`).  
5. Return a near-popular matching set.
